            <p>One small victory does not guarantee permanent peace, for the Hall of Might is still coveted by various powerful forces.</p>

            <p>The banners fly high, and the battle is about to begin. Who will emerge as the ultimate victor?</p>

            <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 my-4 space-y-2">
                <li>Conquest of Lords is held every two weeks.</li>

                <li>The expedition battle lasts 24 hours, and the Lord and their Alliance who continuously occupy the Hall of Might for 8 hours will win. At the end of the expedition, if no Lord has met the conditions, the Lord and their Alliance who have occupied the Hall of Might for the longest time will win.</li>

                <li>During the expedition, the Lord can teleport to other Realms. Lords outside the Enchanted Woodland cannot be attacked or scouted by Lords from other Realms. (If the Castle is defeated within the Enchanted Woodland of another Realm, it will be sent back to a Random location in the original Realm)</li>

                <li>When the Hall of Might and the Spire are occupied by different Alliances, the Spire will continuously attack the Hall of Might, causing substantial damage to the defending troops, and some defending troops will die directly. (The Spire attack will also take effect when the Hall of Might opens war protection)</li>

                <li>When the Lord of this Realm occupies the Hall of Might of another Realm, and the Hall of Might of this Realm is not occupied by invaders, the Hall of Might of this Realm will open special war protection. When the Lord of this Realm defeats the invaders who occupied Hall of Might of this Realm, it will open special war protection. The Hall of Might under war protection can only be attacked or occupied by the Lord of this Realm, and Lords from other Realms cannot attack or occupy it.</li>

                <li>When an Alliance occupies a building for 1 hours, they’ll gain the garrison buff (only buildings that have been occupied for at least 20 minutes count, and at least 2 buildings must be occupied). The more buildings occupied for more than 20 minutes, the greater the buff.</li>

                <li>The effectiveness of unit counters is weakened in the Hall of Might and Spires.</li>

        <H level="h2">How to participate in Conquest of Lords</H>
        <p>During the event you may face 1 or 2 opponents. The priority goal is to defent your own Hall of Might. Secondary goal is to take the Hall in other realms.
            Realms may have NAP agreements so make sure you got this information from your r5 alliance officers or other alliances before the event.
        </p>
        <p>
            Game rules doesn't have mechanics to work as a realm, so usually alliances pick one alliance to host the event. People will join this alliance to defent the Hall of Might together.
        </p>
        <p>
            As soon as the Conquest of Lords begins, strongest players are running to take their Hall and other players are sending their marches to fill the hall with troops and defend it from the opponents. Other players will try to take 4 spires and fill them with troops too.
            One player can send only 1 march to the Hall or one of the spires.
            If a spire was taken by the player from any other alliance than in the Hall, the spire will shoot to the Hall every 10 minutes killing 1% of troops in the Hall. That's why it's usually good to hold all the spires by the same alliance to prevent any additional losses.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your realm don't have NAP agreements and you sent troops to the hall or the spires - you should watch what's happening around. If your opponents have strong players, they may run on your position wiping out the whole spire. In many cases there's no need to take all these losses and it's better to leave the spire.
            Some high power or rogue players may break NAP agreements and attack your spire even with the NAP agreement so it's always better to keep an eye on your troops.
            High power castles may teleport right to the spires to decrease the distance and attack the spire very fast. To prevent it - the whole realm is placing shielded farms in the forest to maximize the path from potential danger to the spires or Hall.
            All the deaths during this event are permanent so be careful befor doing any kind of actions that may kill your troops.
