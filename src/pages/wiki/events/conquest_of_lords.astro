        <H level="h2">How to participate in Conquest of Lords</H>
        <p>During the event you may face 1 or 2 opponents. The priority goal is to defent your own Hall of Might. Secondary goal is to take the Hall in other realms.
            Realms may have NAP agreements so make sure you got this information from your r5 alliance officers or other alliances before the event.
        </p>
        <p>
            Game rules doesn't have mechanics to work as a realm, so usually alliances pick one alliance to host the event. People will join this alliance to defent the Hall of Might together.
        </p>
        <p>
            As soon as the Conquest of Lords begins, strongest players are running to take their Hall and other players are sending their marches to fill the hall with troops and defend it from the opponents. Other players will try to take 4 spires and fill them with troops too.
            One player can send only 1 march to the Hall or one of the spires.
            If a spire was taken by the player from any other alliance than in the Hall, the spire will shoot to the Hall every 10 minutes killing 1% of troops in the Hall. That's why it's usually good to hold all the spires by the same alliance to prevent any additional losses.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your realm don't have NAP agreements and you sent troops to the hall or the spires - you should watch what's happening around. If your opponents have strong players, they may run on your position wiping out the whole spire. In many cases there's no need to take all these losses and it's better to leave the spire.
            Some high power or rogue players may break NAP agreements and attack your spire even with the NAP agreement so it's always better to keep an eye on your troops.
            High power castles may teleport right to the spires to decrease the distance and attack the spire very fast. To prevent it - the whole realm is placing shielded farms in the forest to maximize the path from potential danger to the spires or Hall.
            All the deaths during this event are permanent so be careful befor doing any kind of actions that may kill your troops.
